→ On-chain reputation — every trade builds your score
→ Private P2P messaging — negotiate directly

Built on @midaboratory for #VibeHack2026

How Tekton works 🧵

1. Maker posts an offer (e.g. 0.05 BTC → 5,000 USDC) and locks funds in escrow

2. Taker browses the market, reviews the maker's on-chain reputation, and accepts

3. Smart contract holds both sides — atomic settlement, no rug possible

4. Both traders' reputation scores update on-chain after every trade

No Telegram middlemen. No trust required. Just code.

Under the hood:

• Solidity escrow contract on MIDL Protocol (Bitcoin L2)
• Xverse wallet + ECDSA signature auth
• BTC & Rune token support
• Next.js frontend, fully open source

All trades settle with Bitcoin finality.
